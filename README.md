[ ] Create the backend using Ruby on Rails and any gems of your choosing.

[ ] Create the frontend using Vue, React or Angular. CSS should be coded by hand.

[ ] Database queries should be as performant as possible.

[ ] This should take less than 2 hours of your time, please do not spend any more than that.

[ ] Deliver the project in a github repo.




## Domain quesitons:
* Should Question exist independently of Survey? For now, each question belongs to a single survey
